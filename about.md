I'm Alex Coleman, a research software engineer at the University of Leeds. I did my PhD at Leeds in Molecular Virology studying how a herpesvirus remodelling the nuclear pore complex before jumping out of the lab and doing data science at Leeds Institute of Data Analytics. 

I mainly write python and R code and am interested in software development best practices and tools for reproducible research.
